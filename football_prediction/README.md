# LigaV2 – Match Outcome Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project is my attempt at using machine learning to predict football match outcomes. The idea sounds simple, but there’s a lot going on behind the scenes: gathering data, cleaning it up, building good indicators... and finally training models to see if we can actually make decent predictions!
It involves preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Scikit-learn tools.

This is part of a broader learning journey in data science and predictive modeling.

## 🧠 Goals & Learning Outcomes
I wanted to sharpen my data science skills while working on something I actually enjoy — football. It was the perfect excuse to build a real pipeline from scratch:
- Explore machine learning pipelines for sports prediction
- Practice feature engineering and model evaluation
- Understand dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Learn to interpret model predictions
- Clean and explore data
- Build smart features
- Test and compare models
- Learn from mistakes
